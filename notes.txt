Goal: Make a printable calendar html page because the sites I've used provide 
Word and PDF files and I think it should just be browser based.

Additional: Add a customisation bar for style, and settings which I don't need 
but might be helpful to others like start of week.

Start by grabbing htmlboilerplate from https://html5boilerplate.com/ or #
https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate since I'm out of date.

Seems like the boiler plate is overkill for such a simple task but it's a good 
starting point and I can remove what I don't need.
